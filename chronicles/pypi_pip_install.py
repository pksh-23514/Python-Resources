# Summary:
# ========
# PyPi is the acronym for Python Package Index. It is a repository for Open-Source third-party Python packages.
# It is a standard system where developers can publish and distribute their Python packages.
# The libraries that come internally with Python are the Standard or Built-in Libraries.
# There are many other libraries available that are open-sourced and shared on PyPi.
# Developers create and distribute packages in a specific format called “distributions” which contain all the files needed to install and run their software.
# The "pip install" command can be used to install these packages on the system.
# The 'pip' is a package manager for Python that is used to install and manage software packages written in Python.
# The "pip install" command needs to be run on the Command Line Prompt.
# Syntax: pip install <package-name>
# Where: 'package-name' is the name of the Package that needs to be installed.

# Summary:
# ========
# Object Oriented Programming (OOP) allows Users to create their own Objects and Classes. For larger Programs, OOP is required for organization and reusability.
# The main concept of OOPs is to bind the Data and the Functions that work on those Data as a single unit, so that no other part of the code can access this Data.

# Class is a collection of Objects. It is like an Object constructor that contains the blueprint or prototype from which the Objects are created.
# It is a logical entity that contains some attributes (characteristics) and methods (operations performed).
# Classes are created by keyword 'class'.
# Syntax: class <ClassName>:
#             def __init__(self, param1, param2, ...):
#                 self.param1 = param1
#                 self.param2 = param2
#                 ...
#
#             def <method_name>(self, param1, param2, ...):
#                 ...
#                 Operations to be performed
#                 ...
# The attributes and methods of a Class are accessed using the '.' dot operator.
# The attributes can be of 2 types: Class attributes and Instance attributes.
# Class attributes are shared by all instances of the Class. They can be accessed using the format: (Class_name or Object_name).attribute
# Instance attributes are specific to that instance of the Class. They can be accessed using the format: (Object_name).attribute
# Methods are functions defined inside the body of a Class. They can include Object parameters and other non-Object parameters passed.

# The "__init__" method is the default constructor used to initialize the Objects of the Class.
# The task of constructors is to initialize the Data Members of the Class when an Object of the Class is created.
# It contains a collection of statements that are executed automatically at the time of Object creation.

# The 'self' parameter is used to represent the current instance of the Class being used. It is always pointing to the current Object.
# Whenever, a method of an Object created from a Class is called, the Object is automatically passed as the first argument using the 'self' parameter.
# It is customary to use 'self' as the first parameter in methods of a Class. If it is not provided, an error is generated.
# It is a convention and not a keyword. Any other parameter name instead of 'self' can be used but 'self' is preferred name to increase the readability.

# Note: Since, Python is Dynamically-typed and flexible; proper documentation needs to be provided for the Object parameters to be passed.

# Object is an entity that has a State, Behavior and Identity assosciated with it. In Python, everything (integer, String, List etc.) is an Object.
# State is represented by the attributes of an Object. It also reflects the properties of an Object.
# Behavior is represented by the methods of an Object. It also reflects the response of an Object to other Objects.
# Identity gives a unique name to an Object and enables one Object to interact with other Objects.

# Inheritance is the capability of one Class to derive or inherit properties from another Class.
# The Class that derives it's properties is called Derived Class or Child Class.
# The Class from which the properties are being derived is called the Base Class or Parent Class.
# Syntax: class <Base_Class>:
#             Body
#         class <Derived_Class> (Base_Class):
#             Body
# It provides the reusability of a code. Also, it allows us to add more features to a Class without modifying it.
# It is transitive in nature, which means that if Class B inherits from Class A, then all the sub-Classes of B would automatically inherit from Class A.
# The methods of the Base Class are accessible to the Derived Class. The other methods defined in the Derived Class are only native to it.
# If the "__init__()" of the Base Class is not called, the instance variables defined there will not be available to the Derived Class.

# The "super()" is a Built-in function used to refer to the Base Class. It returns a proxy Object that represents the Base Class.
# It allows to access the Base Class's attributes and methods in the Derived Class. It enables method Overriding and Inheritance.
# The main benefit is there is no need to specify the Base Class name to access it's methods.

# There are 5 types of Inheritance:
# Single Inheritance - When a Child Class inherits from only one Parent Class, it is called Single Inheritance.
# Multiple Inheritance - When a Child Class inherits from multiple Parent Classes, it is called Multiple Inheritances.
# Multi-Level Inheritance - When a Child Class inherits from a Parent Class which in turn is inheriting from it's Parent Class, it is called Multi-Level Inheritance.
# Hierarchical Inheritance - When more than one Child Classes are inheriting from a single Parent Class, it is called Hierarchical Inheritance.
# Hybrid Inheritance - When it is a blend of more than one type of Inheritance, it is called Hybrid Inheritance.

# Polymorphism means the same function name (but different function signatures) being used for different types.
# The key difference is the Data-types of arguments and number of arguments used in the function.
# It lets us define the methods in the Child Class that have the same name as the methods in the Parent Class.
# The Child Class inherits the methods from the Parent Class that can be modified if the method inherited doesn't fit with the Child Class.
# This process of re-implementing a method in the Child Class is called Method Overriding.

# Abstract Class is a blueprint for other sub-Classes. It is a Class that contains one or more Abstract methods.
# An Abstract method is a method that has a declaration but does not have an implementation.
# By defining an Abstract Base Class, a common Application Program Interface (API) for a set of sub-Classes can be defined.
# Abstract Class is never instantiated i.e. no Object shall be created for this Abstract Class.
# An error statement is raised if an Object is raised for such Abstract Class.

# Encapsulation is the idea of wrapping data and methods that work on data within one unit.
# This puts restriction on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modifications of data.
# A Class is an example of Encapsulation as it encapsulates all the data i.e. member functions, variables, etc.
# The goal of Information Hiding is to ensure that an Objectâ€™s state is always valid by controlling access to attributes that are hidden from the outside world.
# Protected Members are by definition those members of the Class that cannot be accessed outside the Class but can be accessed from within the Class and its sub-Classes.
# To accomplish this in Python, the convention followed is by prefixing the name of the member by a single '_' underscore.
# Although the protected variable can be accessed out of the Class as well as in the Derived Class (modified too in derived class), it should be avoided.
# It is customary (convention not a rule) to not access the Protected members out the Class body.
# Private Members are by definition those members of the Class that can neither be accessed outside the Class nor by any of its sub-Classes.
# To prevent accidental changes, a Classâ€™s Private variable can only be changed by the Classâ€™s method and accessed inside the Class only.
# To accomplish this in Python, the convention followed is by prefixing the name of the member by a double '__' underscore.
# Nothing in Python is truly private; internally, the names of Private members are mangled and unmangled on the fly to make them seem inaccessible by their given names.

# Deleting an Object of the Class is done using the 'del' keyword.
# Since everything in Python represents an object in one way or another, it can be used to delete List, Dictionary, variables etc.
# Syntax: del object_name

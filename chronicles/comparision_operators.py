# Summary:
# ========
# The Comparision or Relational operators are used to compare 2 variables with values.
# The Comparison operators include the following:
# Equal to - ==
# Not equal to - !=
# Greater than - >
# Less than - <
# Greater than or equal to - >=
# Less than or equal to - <=

# In Python, the value and it's decimal form is equal.
# Eg. - The integer 3 and the floating-point number 3.0 clearly have the same value, so if (3 == 3.0) is true.
